# De-bee

De-Bee gives you a really simple way to deal with "I owe you"s and expense sharing. Where can you use De-Bee? If you have lunch with friends, one or two of you can pay the expense and then the rest of you will owe them an amount of money. You just register those debts into De-Bee and that's it! Next time, if you pay the account will get balanced.

*We are no longer maintaining this version of de-bee, and due to changes in Google App Engine, the online version will no longer be available as of August 2015.*
