introduction:=<p>Are you tired of sticky calculations every time you meet with friends for lunch or pay something with other people?</p><p>De-Bee gives you a new way to deal with <span class="big">money change</span> and debts. You can have as many groups as you want; each group has a number of people that <span class="big">share a common account</span>.</p><span class="title">When can you use De-Bee?</span><p>If you have lunch with friends, one or two of you can pay the expense and then the rest of you will owe them an amount of money. You just <span class="big">register those debts</span> into De-Bee and that's it! Next time, if you <span class="big">pay</span> the account will get balanced.</p> <p>Any exchange money situation with <span class="big">friends</span> or with any acquaintance can be resolved with De-Bee. De-Bee informs you about your <span class="big">summarized situation</span> for all groups and for each group in particular.</p>

WhatIsBulkFor:=<p>Say you go to lunch with your friends. It's easier if someone pays for the rest of the group and then uploads the debts into De-Bee. Then one of you simply enters below who paid, what consumed each one, how much did they pay, and De-Bee will handle the rest.</p><p>Here at Manas we use it every day at lunch hour. We usually order food, so we see in the group balance who is the one that owes the most, and then we say "Pays: that one", and we specify what consumed each of us.</p> 
Example:=
BulkExample:=Pays: SomeMember<br />AnotherMember: stuff $8<br />MemberOne, MemberTwo: something they both bought $12<br />Buyer: one thing, another thing, and one more $20
