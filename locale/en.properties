introduction:=<p>Are you tired of sticky calculations every time you meet with friends for lunch or pay something with other people?</p><p>De-Bee gives you a new way to deal with <span class="big">money change</span> and debts. You can have as many groups as you want; each group has a number of people that <span class="big">share a common account</span>.</p><span class="title">When can you use De-Bee?</span><p>If you have lunch with friends, one or two of you can pay the expense and then the rest of you will owe them an amount of money. You just <span class="big">register those debts</span> into De-Bee and that's it! Next time, if you <span class="big">pay</span> the account will get balanced.</p> <p>Any exchange money situation with <span class="big">friends</span> or with any acquaintance can be resolved with De-Bee. De-Bee informs you about your <span class="big">summarized situation</span> for all groups and for each group in particular.</p>

WhatIsBulkFor:=<p>Suppose John, Mary and Susan go to lunch. John has a sandwich for $6, Mary has a salad for $4 and Susan a burger with fries for $7. John pays for all of them. You would write this in De-Bee as:</p> <div style="margin-left:36px">Pays: John<br/>Mary: a salad $4<br/>Susan: a burger with fries $7</div> <p>Writing that is exactly the same as issuing the following transactions:</p> <ul> <li>Mary owed John $4 because of a salad</li> <li>Susan owed John $7 because of a burger</li> </ul>

WhatIsCowFor:=<p>Suppose Jhon, Mary, Susan and Paul go get some pizza. It turns out everything cost $60, so it's $15 each, but not everyones has change. So Mary pays $20 and Susan $40. They enter De-Bee and write this:</p> <div style="margin-left:36px">Reason: pizza<br/>Mary: $20<br/>Susan: $40<br/>Paul: $0<br/>Roger: $0</div> <p>Paul and Roger are marked as $0 because although they ate pizza, they didn't pay anything.</p><p>What De-Bee will do is to say: "OK, it's $15 each person, so we can make Paul owe $15 to Susan, and make Roger owe $10 to Susan and $5 to Mary. If you do the math, you'll notice that after these debts everyone paid $15 each.</p>
