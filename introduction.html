<p>Do you feel tired of sticky calculations each time you meet with friends for lunch or pay something with other people?
De-Bee gives you a new way to deal with <font size="+4">money change</font> and debts. You can have as many groups as you want; 
each group has a number of persons that share a common account.</p>
			
<strong>When can you use De-Bee?</strong><br>
<p>If you go lunch with friends one or two of you can pay and then the rest of you will owe them an amount of money, 
you just <font size="+4"> register those debts</font> into De-Bee and that's it, next time you can pay and the account would get balanced.</p>
<p>If at the office you decide to buy something all together someone of you can pay for it and then register the debt the rest of you will have with him; 
then you do not need to <font size="+4">pay</font>  it at the moment it was bought. You can pay that at any further situation.</p>

<p>Any exchange money situation with <font size="+4">friends</font> or any familiar person can be resolved with De-Bee.
De-Bee informs you about your summarized situation for all groups and for each group in particular.</p>

You can:

<ul>
	<li>Create groups; invite your friends to them.</li>
    <li>Join other groups your friends had invited you to.</li>
</ul>

De-Bee is totally secure, no one can fool you assigning a debt to you without your consent.

There are four common actions you will use:

<ul>
	<li>Register a payment you have made to someone</li>
    <li>Register a debt you have with someone</li>
    <li>Register a payment someone has given to you</li>
    <li>Register a debt someone has with you</li>
</ul>
