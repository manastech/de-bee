introduction==<p>Are you tired of sticky calculations every time you meet with friends for lunch or pay something with other people?</p><p>De-Bee gives you a new way to deal with <span class="big">money change</span> and debts. You can have as many groups as you want; each group has a number of people that <span class="big">share a common account</span>.</p><span class="title">When can you use De-Bee?</span><p>If you have lunch with friends, one or two of you can pay the expense and then the rest of you will owe them an amount of money. You just <span class="big">register those debts</span> into De-Bee and that's it! Next time, if you <span class="big">pay</span> the account will get balanced.</p> <p>Any exchange money situation with <span class="big">friends</span> or with any acquaintance can be resolved with De-Bee. De-Bee informs you about your <span class="big">summarized situation</span> for all groups and for each group in particular.</p>
